# OsBot

Discord bot to handle OH Queueing. Handles Nickname assignment and deassignment for OH queue, providing a more streamlined process to Office Hours.

## Installation

1. install elixir
2. clone the repository
3. run mix deps.get to install the dependencies
4. run iex -S mix to launch the bot

## TODO
1. move the discord bot to run with 100% uptime on a server or cloud service
2. Add functionality for querying data to provide students information about when office hours get full (ie. previous semesters show that this time in the semester is when office hours get full, average wait times are x minutes, etc)
3. add text commands and a bot-commands channel for more functionality
